What's the purpose of a .gitignore file?

5. Question 5
Consider the situation where the following commands are executed in a new, empty directory:
git init
touch todo.txt
touch message.txt
git add todo.txt
git commit -m "first commit"
git add message.txt
echo "- Buy cherries" >> todo.txt
git commit -m "second commit"
echo "- Dear Philip," >> message.txt
By the end of these commands, what is the status of this repository?
5.Blank versions of the files todo.txt and message.txt have been committed to the repository. Content added to those files has not yet been committed.
